# Prefetching

React Query supports [Prefetching](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/prefetching#_top) out of the box,
allowing us to manually prime or fetch the data before the user queries it (e.g. on a server).

Although this works with React Query Firebase, be mindful that the data which is prefetched must be serializable. In the case
of hooks such as `useFirestoreQuery` and `useFirestoreDocument`, the result of these hooks is a [`QuerySnapshot`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firestore_.querysnapshot)
or [`DocumentSnapshot`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firestore_.documentsnapshot),

These classes are not serializable, so we're unable to use them in prefetching. Instead we can make use of the `useFirestoreQueryData` or `useFirestoreDocumentData` hooks, which instead return the raw
serializable data from Firestore.

For example, on a server endpoint which requests a products listing:

```js
app.get('/products', async (req, res) => {
  await queryClient.prefetchQuery('products', getProducts);

  return ...
});
```

```jsx
function Products() {
  const ref = query(collection(firestore, "products"));
  const query = useFirestoreQueryData(["products"], ref);

  return ...
}
```

In the above example, the data for the Query Key is prefetched on the server, and queried on the client.
However, instead of the hook state initially being `loading`, the data will be immidiatley available on the client.

Make sure your server query and client query return the same data model.
