This page covers how to query Firestore collections, and various techniques
to get the best results from the library.

## Providing a query reference

To start querying a collection, you need to provide the hooks with a Query reference
created directly from the `firebase/firestore` library. The reference can be a simple
collection pointer or a fully constrained query using the querying functionality
provided by the Firestore SDK.

For example, to create a query to a `products` collection:

```js
import { collection } from "firebase/firestore";
import { firestore } from "./firebase";

const ref = collection(firestore, "products");
```

Or if you wish to provide query constaints:

```js
import { collection, query, limit, where } from "firebase/firestore";
import { firestore } from "./firebase";

const ref = query(
  collection(firestore, "products"),
  limit(10),
  where("state", "==", "active")
);
```

## Basic example

With your query reference in hand, you can get started.

The library provides 2 main hooks for querying collections; `useFirestoreQuery` and `useFirestoreQueryData`.
Each hook is similar however returns slightly different results (see the next section for more detail).
Within a component, import and provide a hook a query key and the reference:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useFirestoreQuery } from "@react-query-firebase/firestore";
import {
  query,
  collection,
  limit,
  QuerySnapshot,
  DocumentData,
} from "firebase/firestore";
import { firestore } from "../firebase";

function Products() {
  // Define a query reference using the Firebase SDK
  const ref = query(collection(firestore, "products"));

  // Provide the query to the hook
  const query = useFirestoreQuery(["products"], ref);

  if (query.isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  const snapshot = query.data;

  return snapshot.docs.map((docSnapshot) => {
    const data = docSnapshot.data();

    return <div key={docSnapshot.id}>{data.name}</div>;
  });
}
```

The hook returns an instance of [`useQuery`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useQuery)
containing a `QuerySnapshot`. By using the `useQuery` hook you're able to reactivly handle events
such as loading, errors, success, refetching and lots more.

> If this doesn't make much sense to you, please check out the React Query documentation before proceeding!

## Realtime updates

A powerful feature of Firestore is being able to easily subscribe to changes on the database. Luckily,
the hooks handle this by providing a `subscribe` flag to the hook options:

```js
const query = useFirestoreQuery(["products"], ref, {
  subscribe: true,
});
```

If data is changed which touches your provided query, the hook update the data for
the query.

Anytime the Query Key changes, your component unmounts or fresh data is required
the hook will automatically handle unsubscribing from new events.

## Snapshots & Data

When Firestore returns data from a query, it does not provide the raw document data - instead
we are provided a `QuerySnapshot` containing an array of `DocumentSnapshot` classes. Although
these classes provide useful functionality, we sometimes just want the data from the database
for convinience.

As shown above the `useFirestoreQuery` hook returns a `QuerySnapshot`, which requires
developers to iterate over `DocumentSnapshot` instances and extract the data:

```jsx
const query = useFirestoreQuery(["products"], ref);

const snapshot = query.data;

return snapshot.docs.map((docSnapshot) => {
  const data = docSnapshot.data();
  return <div key={docSnapshot.id}>{data.name}</div>;
});
```

If you are only interested in the data, the `useFirestoreQueryData` hook returns exactly this:

```jsx
const query = useFirestoreQueryData(["products"], ref);

return query.data.map((document) => {
  return <div key={document.id}>{document.name}</div>;
});
```

## Query Keys & References

A core concept of this library is the principles of React Query. React Query will
refetch your data based on the default (or your own) configuration and when you update
a Query Key.

If your query changes, ensure your Query Key also changes to reflect this. For example,
the following **will not work**:

```jsx
// This does not work!!!
const [type, setType] = useState("swag");
const ref = query(collection, where("type", "==", type));

const query = useFirestoreQueryData(["products"], ref);

<button onClick={() => setType("merch")}>Update product type</button>;
```

Only when React Query performs a refetch will your data change, making it unpredictable.

To predicitably update your data, ensure your Query Key reflects your reference:

```jsx
// This will work!!
const [type, setType] = useState("swag");
const ref = query(collection, where("type", "==", type));

// The Query Key now reflects the ref change
const query = useFirestoreQueryData(["products", { type }], ref);

<button onClick={() => setType("merch")}>Update product type</button>;
```

Alongside being predictable, this now benefits from being an individual query
which is cached. To learn more, read about [Query Keys](TODO),.

## Cached / Server Data

When querying a collection without subscribing to changes, you
can specify a `source` parameter to indiciate whether the
cached or server documents should be queried:

```js
useFirestoreQuery("products", query, {
  subscribe: false, // or undefined
  source: "cache", // or 'server'
});
```

If no value is provided, a combination of cache and server will be used (as default).

### Include metadata changes

If querying a collection by subscribing, you can also subscribe to metadata changes on
documents.

```js
useFirestoreQuery("products", query, {
  subscribe: true,
  includeMetadataChanges: true,
});
```

## Named Queries

If you have the ability to [data bundles](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2021/04/firestore-supports-data-bundles.html),
you can instead provide a named query to the hook. The hook will first download the query and then cache it based on the
Firestore instance and bundle name.

```js
import { loadBundle } from "firebase/firestore";
import { firestore } from "../firebase";

// Somewhere in your app...
const resp = await fetch("/bundles/products");

// Load in the bundle (named "products")
await loadBundle(firestore, bundle.body);
```

Elsewhere in your application, provide a named query function instead of a query:

```jsx
import { useFirestoreQuery, namedQuery } from "@react-query-firebase/firestore";
import { firestore } from "../firebase";

function Products() {
  const query = useFirestoreQuery(
    ["products"],
    firestore,
    namedQuery(firestore, "products")
  );
}
```

If the bundle does not exist an error will be thrown.

## Paginated / Infinite Queries

## Modifying data responses

The library allows the passing of all React Query hook options to the library hooks.
One such option is a `select` function which allows modification of data before it is
returned from the query.

This functionality is really powerful. For example if we wished to return an array of
product IDs rather than the entire document:

```js
const query = useFirestoreQuery(
  ["products"],
  ref,
  {
    subscribe: true,
  },
  {
    select(snapshot) {
      return snapshot.docs.map((docSnapshot) => docSnapshot.id);
    },
  }
);

const data = query.data; // ['id1', 'id2', ...]
```

Another usecase is returning a single document from a query when you do not know the ID:

```js
/* This example also works with the useFirestoreQueryData hook */

// Users can only have a single active subscription
const findActiveSubscription = query(
  collection(firestore, "subscriptions"),
  where("status", "==", "active"),
  limit(1)
);

// Override the return type generic:
const query = useFirestoreQuery(
  "subscription",
  findActiveSubscription,
  {
    subscribe: true,
  },
  {
    select(snapshot) {
      if (snapshot.empty) {
        return null;
      }

      return snapshot.docs[0];
    },
  }
);

// Data will contain a single document or null.
if (query.data) {
  console.log('Your subscription: ', query.data);
}
```

## React Query options

Each hook allows us to provide [`useQuery`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useQuery)
options as the last argument, opening up the possibility to integrate the library easily across
any application.

For example, we can handle state (e.g. success and error) reactivly and also trigger functions within
the same workflow:

```jsx
const query = useFirestoreQuery(
  "subscription",
  findActiveSubscription,
  {
    subscribe: true,
  },
  {
    onSuccess(snapshot) {
      toast.success('Data loaded successfully!')
    },
    onError(error) {
      toast.error('Woops, something went wrong!');
    },
  }
);

if (query.isError) {
  return <Error error={query.error} />;
}

if (query.isSuccess) {
  return <ProductList data={query.data} />;
}
```
