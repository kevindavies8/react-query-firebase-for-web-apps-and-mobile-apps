# Authentication State

This page covers how you can subscribe and listen to the users authentication state, along with some
useful tips to get the best results from the library.

## Subscribing to updates

Applications taking advantage of Firebase Authentication will more than likely want to subscribe to
the users authentication state, knowing whether they're signed-in our out.

The `useAuthUser` hook enables you to do exactly this!

```jsx
import { useAuthUser } from "@react-query-firebase/auth";
import { auth } from "./firebase";

function App() {
  const user = useAuthUser(["user"], auth);

  if (user.isLoading) {
    return <div />;
  }

  if (user.data) {
    return <div>Welcome {user.data.displayName}!</div>;
  }

  return <div>Not signed in.</div>;
}
```

Anytime your users state changes, the hooks data will be updated allowing you to reactively handle updates
within your application. If the user is authenticated, the hook returns the
[`User`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/auth.user) interface, otherwise it's `null`.

## Sharing a Query Key

One great feature of React Query is that by providing a [Query Key](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/query-keys)
we can share state between components, without worrying about multiple calls and listeners being created all over
our application.

It's common you'll likey want to access the users state in many components. Traditionally you'd usually store the
user in context and access it. With React Query, we don't need to worry about that. Instead if we provided the same
Query Key, the request will only be triggered once!

```jsx
import { useAuthUser } from "@react-query-firebase/auth";
import { auth } from "./firebase";

function App() {
  const user = useAuthUser(["user"], auth);

  if (user.isLoading) {
    return <div />;
  }

  if (user.data) {
    return <User />;
  }

  return <div>Not signed in.</div>;
}

function User() {
  const user = useAuthUser(["user"], auth);

  return <div>Welcome {user.data.displayName}!</div>;
}
```

In this case, the `User` component will reuse the data from the already created `user` query, internally
utilizing one authentication listener.

## React Query options

The hook also allows us to provide React Query options, supporting all of the options the
[`useQuery`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useQuery) supports! For example, we could handle
side effects with ease:

```jsx
const user = useAuthUser(["user"], auth, {
  onSuccess(user) {
    if (user) {
      console.log("User is authenticated!", user);
    }
  },
  onError(error) {
    console.error("Failed to subscribe to users authentication state!");
  },
});
```
