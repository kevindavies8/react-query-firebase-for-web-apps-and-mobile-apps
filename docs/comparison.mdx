title: Comparing React Query Firebase
description: How does React Query Firebase differ from other solutions?
---

There are plenty of other solutions to managing your Firebase data with React, such as [ReactFire](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire) and
[react-firebase-hooks](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks), so why was this one built?

This library is backed by [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), rather than a custom built solution to manage state. React Query itself is an
extreamly popular library that is used for remote data synchronization across your application. Out of the box React Query handles caching, background updates
and stale data with zero configuration. It also provides tools such as DevTools, infininiate-loading APIs, data pre-fetching, mutation tools and much more.

Using React Query allows us to focus on integration with Firebase, rather than trying to figure out all of these complex solutions. It also allows developers
to integarte with existing React Query projects.

Take a look at [`useQuery`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useQuery) and [`useMutation`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useMutation) to see how
much functionality React Query provides.

### Pre-fetching

You can pre-fetch data on the server and have it available on the client using [SSR](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/ssr#_top), for example:

On the server:

```js
import { dehydrate, QueryClient } from 'react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

// For example: `getPosts` calls the Firebase Admin SDK to get the posts
await queryClient.prefetchQuery('posts', getPosts);

// Load dehydratedState into your application
const dehydratedState = dehydrate(queryClient)
```

On the client:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useFirestoreQueryData } from '@react-query-firebase/firestore';

function Posts() {
  const ref = collection(firebase, 'posts');
  const query = useFirestoreQueryData('posts', ref);
}
```
